# Bike_buyer_prediction
In this repo I am using the data vTargetBuyers.csv and vTargetMailCustomer.csv to make ML classification prediction.
I've used data preprocessing to check and clean the data and also implemented one-hot encoding for nominal data and did min-max normalization of the data before applying ML algorithms.
This project was part of my Data Mining class.
